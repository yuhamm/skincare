        <!-- Cleansing is one of the most crucial steps when completing your skincare routine as it removes all of the build-ups such as dirt, oil, and other unwanted debris. It clears all your pores allowing the sebum to reach the skin‚Äôs surface which decreases the chances of breakouts and prevents the production of excess oil.  It also helps manage the PH level of the skin which helps boosts the hydration on your skin. Dehydration skin looks and will feel quite rough. Cleansing helps maintain clear skin as the sebum protects the skin as it forms a barrier layer that prevents the penetration of bacteria and other harmful agents. However, if you stop cleansing your face, many consequences will arise such as clogging your pores which may lead to major breakouts, irritations due to dehydrated skin, and can even develop itchiness which will ultimately break the skin barrier.

Natural fragrances are extracted from natural sources while synthetic fragrances are made from a mixture of many different chemical compounds. Fragrance is not essential to a skincare product because it has no direct advantages for the skin. In fact, the purpose of including fragrance in skincare is to create a sensorial experience. It is important to note that fragrance can cause irritation in some skin types.

Artificial colours can block your pores causing irritation and inflammation that leads to pimples, and increases the risk of sensitivity. The chemicals used in these colours can even be absorbed into your body, causing serious harm.

                <td>One common ingredient found in skincare products is alcohol, which can make the skincare product last longer and reduce the density of the formula, making it smoother and easier to apply. Alcohol can also prevent the growth of bacteria in the product. The addition to alcohol to a skincare product can also help its penetration into the skin and further eliminates shine through its drying properties. Denatured alcohol (or SD alcohol) can come in the form of ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. These forms can cause your skin to overproduce oil as well as weaken and sensitise your skin by causing damage to the skin protection barrier. Therefore, if denatured or SD alcohol is one of the first five ingredients listed, I would recommend that you avoid this product due to its high concentration of a potentially irritating ingredient. However, there are also particular alcohols that are considered beneficial, i.e. fatty alcohols. Fatty alcohols can come in forms called cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and propylene glycol. These fatty alcohols are obtained from natural ingredients that are rich in fatty acid that can help boost your skin barrier and help in hydration.

This oil is not recommended for acne-prone skin as it can clog your pores and cause breakouts. There is also a small chance of irritation if the skin is going through a purification process to remove the contaminants and impurities.

                <td>Retinol is a type of Vitamin A. Retinol is beneficial because this substance promotes skin cell renewal and also clears your pores, helping with acne-prone skin. The exfoliating properties in retinol helps exfoliate the outer layer of the skin and prevents dead skin cells from clogging thanks to presence of keratolytics, which are medications used to dissolve skin flakes. Retinol also helps with anti-aging by increasing the production of collagen, which makes your face more plumped and youthful. However, retinol products should not be overused, and in fact, it is advisable to phase in your usage of retinol for your skin to adjust to it. If retinol is overused, your skin will start to dry out, making it look worse before it gets better. In addition, users of retinol must always use a lot of sunscreen during the day.

This ingredient improves the skin barrier function, protects the skin from irritants and promotes faster wound-healing. However, it is important to note that glycerin can trigger allergic reactions in some people. Although it is a natural product, high concentrations can lead to irritation and/or allergic reaction.

                <td>Green tea extract contains a substance called EGCG, which is the richest source of antioxidants. EGCG is naturally present in green tea and can prevent a process called lipid peroxidation (which means that free radicals destroy the cells). Green tea extract is very effective for keeping your look more youthful because it improves skin elasticity and sun damage. On top of that, it is good for acne-prone skin due to its anti-inflammatory properties and reduction of sebum production. Moisturizers with a 3% concentration of green tea extract can reduce sebum production by 70%.

                <td>Niacinamide is one of the two major forms of vitamin B3.  The keratin inside helps build proteins, which gives your skin a healthy glow for a number of reasons. Not only does it minimise your pores, but it also reduces dullness by locking in moisture. Another function of niacinamide is that it can improve uneven skin tone by rebuilding skin cells and protecting them from the sun. It softens lines and wrinkles and at the same time strengthens the weakened top layer of skin. One downside that needs to be considered is that people with preexisting allergies may get an allergic reaction because niacinamide can cause the body to release histamine, which is a chemical allergen in the body.

This acid is a humectant, meaning that it adds hydration to your skin, holding up to 1000 times its mass in water. Another advantage of hyaluronic acid is its antioxidant property, meaning that it is soothing and restorative. It can protect your skin from environmental damage like pollution.

This ingredient absorbs the excess oils in the pores and reduces redness.  However, there are downsides that consumers need to be aware of. It may leave skin dry for the first-time user because of the amount of oil being removed. Salicylic acid is not suitable for people with dry or sensitive skin. This ingredient comes from the same family of chemical compounds as aspirin, meaning that users should avoid this skincare product if they are allergic to aspirin.

With its anti-inflammatory and anti oxidising properties, it helps with burns, sunburn, small abrasions, cuts, dry skin, frostbite, cold sores, eczema, psoriasis, and inflammatory acne. In addition. it reduces pain, swelling, or soreness of wounds and treats fungal and bacterial infections effectively as well. Importantly, aloe vera can also help repair sun-damaged skin and slow down the aging process of the skin. Although this is unlikely, some people may feel an initial stinging or burning when they apply it to dry or sensitive skin.

It can hydrate dry skin and stop the inflammatory process that causes effects like hyperpigmentation and wrinkles. It has skin brightening properties that help lighten dark spots and diminish the appearance of hyperpigmentation so that the skin will take on an even colour. Algae extract also contains an antioxidant that helps reduce fine lines and offers protection against UV rays.

It promotes the synthesis of collagen (the main structural protein found in skin), maintains skin hydration, and protects and brightens skin by reducing oxidative damage. This oil has anti-inflammatory properties that help treat acne because it is non-comedogenic, meaning that it does not clog the pores, and is useful for wound healing and reducing redness. Jojoba oil can balance your skin‚Äôs natural oil production and is hypoallergenic, which has a low risk of causing irritation.
